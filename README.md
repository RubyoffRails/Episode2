Episode2 - Superfight
=====================

A Game engine with Fighters, turns, and Matches

Your Assignment
---------------

1. Instead of randomly selecting the winner of a turn, use the Move's ranking to determine a winner
2. Output to the screen a listing of the turns and who won

Extra Credit (challenging)
------------

1. Instead of the game auto-completing the turns, ask the player if they want to strike or block
2. Strike vs Strike should let the higher rank win
3. Strike vs Block should randomly select a winner (or choose a different decision tree here)
4. Block vs Block should retry
